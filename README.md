## 🎮 About the Game

This is my own extended version of the classic **Snake** game – built entirely from scratch as my first programming project.

You control a hungry snake that grows longer with every meal, but I didn’t stop there…

## 🧪 Game Modes & Features

- 🟡 **Classic Mode**  
  Traditional Snake gameplay – collect food, grow longer, avoid hitting yourself.

- 🔁 **Wall Pass Mode**  
  Toggle the ability to move through one edge of the screen and appear on the opposite side.

- 🧱 **Random Terrain Mode**  
  Adds randomly placed obstacles to the map at each new round for extra challenge.

## 🧠 What I Learned

> _"This project showed me that even with basic tools, you can build full experiences from scratch – and opened the door to game development."_ 🚪🎮

- ✅ Practiced C# fundamentals: loops, conditions, arrays, classes
- 🧩 Built logic for movement, collisions, and score tracking
- 🔄 Created modular systems with toggleable mechanics
- 🛠️ Gained confidence debugging and thinking like a developer

## ⚠️ Developer Note

> This was my **first-ever game project**, so the code is **rough and unpolished**, but it represents a milestone:  
> **It’s where my passion for game development truly began.**

## 🔭 Future Improvements (if revisited)

- Clean up and refactor code structure
- Add sound and animation
- Port to Unity or create GUI version
- Polish logic and user experience
